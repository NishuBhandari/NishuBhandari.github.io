                    style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 20px 50px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    In today’s world, environmental destruction and the overconsumption of natural resources have led to
                    a pressing need for sustainable practices.
                    The slogan “Recycle, Reuse, Rethink” speaks best how best to cope with environmental problems that
                    this world is facing by ourplanet. This project explores
                    the importance of these three principles and highlights global initiatives, innovations, and news
                    trends that aim to reduce waste, conserve resources,
                    and shift our mindset towards more sustainable practices. As we confront challenges such as climate
                    change, plastic pollution, and resource depletion,
                    these principles offer practical solutions that can be adopted on individual, corporate, and
                    governmental levels. The following sections will delver
                    into the latest global developments, highlight innovative recycling and reusing technologies, and
                    discuss the importance of rethinking the way we approach
                    consumption.

                <h2>The Global Crisis of Waste and Pollution<br></h2>

                <p
                    style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 20px 50px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    The world’s waste problem has reached alarming levels, with over 2 billion tons of waste generated
                    globally each year, according to the World Bank. Of this,
                    38% is managed through recycling, while the rest ends up in landfills or is incinerated,
                    contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution.</p>

               
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 35px ;"> POLLUTION</h2>Pollution is
                the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.
                The three major types of pollution are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution.<br> <br>
                <!-- <img src="pollution.png" alt="" style="position: relative; left: 40%; border-radius: 10px;"> -->
                <h3 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px ;">AIR
                    POLLUTION</h3>
                <img src="POLLUTION.jpg" alt=""
                    style="position: relative; left: 40%; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical,
                physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.

                Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources
                of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide,
                ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other
                diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.

                WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline
                limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the
                highest exposures..<br>
                <!--  -->
                <h3 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px ;">WATER
                    POLLUTION</h3>
                <img src="WATERPOLLUTION.jpg" alt=""
                    style="position: relative; left: 40%; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their
                uses. It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers,
                reservoirs and groundwater.
                Factories discharge toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and other waste products into nearby rivers, lakes,
                and oceans. Common pollutants include lead, mercury, and other hazardous chemicals that harm aquatic
                life and contaminate drinking water sources .Farming activities introduce pesticides, herbicides, and
                fertilizers into the water supply through runoff, especially after rainfall. This can lead to nutrient
                pollution, which causes algal blooms, depletes oxygen levels, and harms fish and other aquatic
                organisms.Everyday household activities, like washing dishes, bathing, and laundry, release soaps,
                detergents, and other chemicals into the water system. Improperly treated wastewater can carry
                pathogens, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants into rivers and lakes.Plastic bags, bottles, and
                other forms of plastic waste end up in oceans, rivers, and lakes, where they break down into
                microplastics that are ingested by marine life and eventually enter the human food chain<br>

                    style="position: relative; left: 40%; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Humans contribute to soil pollution in various ways, primarily through industrial, agricultural, and
                urban activities. One major source is the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in
                agriculture, which introduces harmful substances like nitrogen, phosphorus, and synthetic chemicals that
                can disrupt soil health, reduce biodiversity, and contaminate groundwater. Industrial waste, including
                heavy metals, toxic chemicals, and byproducts from factories, often ends up in soil through improper
                disposal or accidental spills, making it difficult for plants and microorganisms to thrive.
                Additionally, landfills and improper waste disposal practices release pollutants like plastics, metals,
                and hazardous materials into the soil, leading to long-lasting contamination. Construction and urban
                expansion also contribute to soil pollution, as excavated or disturbed soil can release pollutants, and
                construction materials often contain chemicals that leach into surrounding areas <br>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px ;">MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT POLLUTION</h3>
                <p> These are the measures given by government to prevent excess air pollution : Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 was enacted by the Indian Parliament to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution.
                    The Act aims to protect and improve the quality of air and to prevent and control air pollution in India.

<p>Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme: Earlier, farmers lacked information relating to soil type, soil deficiency and soil moisture content. To address these issues, the Government of India launched the Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme in 2015. The SHC is used to assess the current status of soil health, and when used over time, to determine changes in soil health. The SHC displays soil health indicators and associated descriptive terms, which guide farmers to make necessary soil amendments.

                <p>
                    Countries like Kenya, Sri Lanka and Canada have introduced plastic bans or implemented stricter
                    regulations to reduce plastic waste. In 2023, the UN announced
                    a global treaty aimed at ending plastic pollution by 2040,<br> focusing on reducing plastic
                    production, improving recycling systems, and encouraging alternative
                    materials.<br></p>

                <h2>Recycle: Closing the Loop</h2>
                <p>Recycling is not just a buzzword; it's a vital component of a sustainable future. By processing
                    materials to create new products, we reduce the need for raw resources and curb the energy-intensive
                    production processes.
                    From paper and plastic to electronics, recycling is the bridge between waste and a renewed
                    lifecycle.</p>
